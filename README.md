# rate_limiter



## Rails Version

This gem has only been tested on Rails 3.2. There is no reason that I am aware of that would prevent it from working on all versions of Rails 3 (and Rails 4 when it is released).

## Installation

Add the gem to your project's Gemfile:

    gem 'rate_limiter'

Add `rate_limit` to the models you want to rate limit.

## API Summary

## Contributing

If you feel like you can add something useful to rate_limiter then don't hesitate to contribute! To make sure your fix/feature has a high chance of being included, please do the following:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. I will only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate: `bundle && rake`

3. Add a test for your change. Only adding tests for existing code, refactoring, and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, you need a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

I can't guarantee that I will accept the change, but if I don't I will be sure to let you know why!

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted, taken straight from the Ruby on Rails guide:

* Use Rails idioms and helpers
* Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it
* Update the documentation, guides, or whatever is affected by your contribution

Yes, I am well aware of the irony of asking for tests when there are effectively none right now. This gem is a work in progress.
